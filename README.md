# Customer_segmentation_k_means_and_DBSCAN

This project demonstrates an in-depth analysis of the Online Retail Dataset using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and patterns within the dataset by applying various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, DBSCAN, and others.

Key Features:
** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): ** A comprehensive exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, trends, and anomalies.

Clustering Techniques: Implementation of popular unsupervised learning algorithms to group similar data points and identify hidden patterns.

    K-Means Clustering: Partitioning data into distinct clusters based on similarity.
    
    DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering): Identifying clusters of varying shapes and handling noise in the dataset.
    
    Other Algorithms: Additional clustering methods to compare and contrast results.

Visualizations: Clear and insightful visual representations of the clusters and analysis results.

Insights: Actionable conclusions drawn from the clustering process to better understand customer behavior, product segmentation, and more.

This notebook serves as a practical guide for applying unsupervised learning to real-world datasets, showcasing how clustering can be used to derive valuable business insights.
